This platform analyses market data to detect potential liquidity crises in London equities (LSE) and provides actionable RED/AMBER/GREEN alerts with trading recommendations.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Risk Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of liquidity ratios and volatility spikes
- **Alerting System**:
  - 🔴 **RED** (≥85% risk): Immediate liquidation recommended
  - 🟡 **AMBER** (≥70% risk): Reduce exposure advised
  - 🟢 **GREEN** (<70% risk): Normal monitoring
- **Multi-Asset Analysis**: Simultaneous monitoring of TESCO (TSCO.L) and BP (BP.L) liquidity
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualisation of liquidity ratios, risk scores and market indicators
- **Automated Recommendations**: Actionable trading suggestions based on risk thresholds
- **SQL-Powered Feature Engineering**: Production-grade liquidity metrics calculated using SQL window functions
- **Transmission Latency Analysis**: Measures market reaction time to interest rate shocks

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit these flags in `config.py`:

```python
TEST_MODE = True      # Set to False for real market analysis (uses simulated risk scores when True)
SHOW_DASHBOARD = True # Toggle graphical dashboard display
VERBOSE = True        # Show detailed progress messages
```

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Transmission Latency**: Markets take approximately **7.75 days** (median: 6 days) to reach 50% of maximum response to interest rate shocks
- **Volatility Impact**: Rate shocks increase volatility by an average of **+30.84%**, though correlation with shock magnitude is weak (r ≈ -0.095)
- **Risk Thresholds**: 
  - Liquidity ratio < 0.4 triggers crisis conditions
  - 70/30 weighting: 70% liquidity ratio + 30% volatility change
